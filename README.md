Resume Screening Automation
Project Overview

This project automates the process of resume filtering and candidate ranking by matching resumes against a given Job Description (JD).
It leverages BERT embeddings for semantic similarity and also extracts skills from resumes.

The app is built with Streamlit and provides an easy-to-use web interface where you can:

Paste a Job Description

Upload multiple resumes (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

Extract skills from each resume

Rank resumes based on similarity with the JD

Download results as a CSV file
